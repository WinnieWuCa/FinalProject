My friend made a reservation for 14 people and more than 14 people showed up. The owner became angry at my friend for having more people than the reservation. We filled up one side of the restaurant and everyone ordered a full meal and most people added drinks to their orders as well. I would think the restaurant would be happy that they have a full house but they were not. The service:Service was sub par. They were very slow to take our orders and didn''t come by to refill our beverages and or add more things to the orders placed. At 3pm we were told they were closing and we all had to leave immediately. The ambiance:This is a very casual breakfast joint. The Food:There were very few gluten free items on the menu. Two ladies ordered the Niçoise salad and they were both really disappointed with it. They said it was bland and the dressing tasted like nothing (it was presented really nicely and hearing their review made me glad I didn''t order it). I ordered the rancheros made gluten and dairy free. My dish was really good but I was still hungry after I ate it since certain things were missing from my dish due to my food allergies. My other friends who ordered breakfast dishes seemed happy with what they ordered so I would recommend you stick with the breakfast options. In all honesty, I won''t be rushing back here.');

Had a great selection of apps, like the calamari and the goat cheese salad. All very yummy and disappeared. For my main I had the Tagliatelle with Shredded Duck.

With the traditional style decor and the generous portion of delicious Italian cuisine, Trattoria Leonardo is a fantastic restaurant if you''re in the mood for a taste of Italy. Price:The price of the food is very reasonable for what you get. Prices average in the $15-$22. So a great deal for what you''re getting. Additionally, you get free bruschetta and more bread with you''re entrees so you won''t leave hungry at this restaurant. Service: Service was excellent, staff was friendly and attentive. Food came out fast. Can''t ask for anything more.Food: The food was hands-down delicious. This is my 3rd visit at this restaurant and they''ve impressed each time with the flavors of the food. You can taste the freshness through the food; it''s seasoned nicely without being overly salty. Perfect Italian cuisine.Atmosphere: The atmosphere transforms the restaurant into a traditional old-school Italian restaurant with paintings and signage. It adds a lot to the overall experience of the restaurant. However, I do think the restaurant could have a small revamp to make it more "traditional" some of the decor looks old and just an old way.');

Arrived without a reservation and was immediately seated. Very old school Italian. The waiters are from Italy and very good. We had different dishes.

INSERT INTO review_info(Restaurant_Name,Review) VALUES ('Trattoria Leonardo','Date night! An excuse to get dressed up and try a "fancier" resto.We arrived around 5:00 on a Friday and the restaurant was half full.  We were seated at a cozy table for two in the back corner by the mural.  They do have bruschetta on the menu, but they also give it to you complimentary along with some plain bread.  I enjoyed the bruschetta but the crust was a little too hard for my gums.  Other than that, all flvours were present. I decided to order my go to veal parm and the bf got the stuffed chicken.  We also ordered a ceasar salad to start which was a pretty generous portion.  We mentioned to the waiter that we were going to share and they split the order onto two plates before serving. Nice! The salad was generously dressed but was missing a certain something.  Maybe not enough garlic?  It was still enjoyable though.  Our mains didn''t take too long to come out.  Very big portion.  My boyfriend and I were not a big fan of the pasta..  It was pretty large in size and not as soft as I would''ve liked it to be.  I prefer a smaller penne that they use in most restaurants. The veal was nice and cheesy.  No complaints.  My boyfriend''s stuffed chicken was exactly how I make mine, which is obviously bombass.  For dessert,I HAD to try their tiramisu.  It was odd looking and I don''t understand how they got it onto the plate lol.  I was not a fan of it and would not order again.  The cake portion was a little too dense.  There was so much cream.  Yes, it was light, but all the ingredients did not mesh well together.  I felt like it was just everywhere. My boyfriend enjoyed the lightness of the cream though.  The only thing I kind of got ''sad'' about lol, is when I asked our waiter to take a photo of us before our meal, he said he was too busy and would come back later.  He wasn''t rude or anything about it, but I just felt so rejected lol.  No one has ever turned me down at a restaurant when I''ve asked to take a picture,  I understand he was busy, I just felt so *insert mouth open emoji*.  He did come back, of course while were eating and I politely declined.  Helllooo, we''re eating.  At the end of everything, he did end up taking our photo.  Another thing was that he seemed annoyed when he brought our bill unannounced and then I told him I had a $10 off coupon.  He didn''t come back to our table after dessert and I kept trying to get his attention to ask for the bill.  He ended up just coming with the bill without us asking.  I WOULD have told him beforehand, if I had gotten his attention.   He was just deadass so busy. Other than those two things, meal and atmosphere was good.  Every table was full by the time we left.  All servers are older males.  Think servers at La Castile or Zorro''s.');

INSERT INTO review_info(Restaurant_Name,Review) VALUES ('Trattoria Leonardo','Not Sure how the ratings preceding mine were high. I''ll tell you , if your remotely an Italian , this is by far .. the worst restaurant . Growing up in the area , I''ve been obligated to try this place again and again with friends .  Firstly , 14 years ago, I wouldn''t put my sons car seat on the red carpet that''s 30 years old and still is there today . To start we walked it from the back parking ( a new perspective but not better ) the kitchen is dirty and dated . The atmosphere .. sadly the same and dirty and musty . If you''ve been to Zorro steakhouse ( you''ll know the same goes here ) I don''t often write a rating but I hope the owner pays attention . Aside from a much needed renovation , bathrooms , lose the dirty carpet . I still tried to hope the food won''t be a disappoint again.  Let me reiterate , having a partner/ mate in an unrelated pub business, I have no agenda, but honesty for other Yelp users who like myself rely on the feedback for well spent earned dollars . So, upon arriving , here''s the positive , our server was very nice and obliging . I''ll cut to the chase. Every special was gone. No steak no chicken, no veal chop,  but there was frozen chicken for pasta ?  So we started with and ordered mussels ... Luke warm and rubbery and so over cooked they were almost hard to find in the shell. My pasta .. chicken with asparagus in cream sauce . The chicken was like rubber and boiled tastelessness, luke warm as well. On the positive , they did get the aldente pasta texture  right. The cream sauce like water that no amount of cheese or chili''s could revive . Minestrone soup.. bland and watery . Should have been thick and flavorful with lots of beans ...My partner had Frittura Mista... actually .. quite good, I''ll give you that . The bill was not cheap    .  I will never be obligated again to try try try again this place , as I was up in the night not feel well to boot .  Sorry for the review but I hope they learn from my remarks .');

The waitstaff are all older, attentive and professional, and they all speak italian!  I have so many great things to say about this place, which serves food that is both upscale and comfortingly home-style.For example, we were there recently for a Mother''s Day Eve (Saturday) dinner. We were promptly offered water, our orders were taken and we received complimentary bruschetta, which was delicious. The tomatoes tasted so fresh and complimented the bread nicely. We shared appetizers of garlic bread, calamari and grilled shrimp. All were excellent: the garlic bread had a full, garlic flavour, the calamari done perfectly and the shrimp were substantial with a very fresh taste. Very good house wine list too. We went with the very good Baby Amarone on the list.Leonardo''s seems to specialize in veal, so I ordered the Veal Gorgonzolo: good gorgonzola flavour in the creamy sauce, tender veal, mushrooms and a really large side of pasta. Everyone agreed that this was one of the two star dishes at our table, the other one being the Osso Buco. It had the richest, deepest beef gravy, and the amazingly fall-apart tender osso buco. Our party had also ordered very delicious dishes in addition to these: veal marsala, canneloni. and chicken with mushrooms and pesto cream sauce. All of them were very good. Did I mention that the portions are also very large?The desserts were great - the ice creams, tira misu and creme caramel were what we ordered - not overly sweet but very refreshing. Rather large portions, suitable for sharing.From the decor to the waitstaff to the decor to the  food, Leonardo''s was an excellent experience - highly recommended.');

It''s a cute starter but it lacks in flavour concerning everything.Baked Goat Cheese Polenta w/ Sundried Tomato Paste & Pesto (3.5/5)There was a tiny, tiny, tiny teaspoon of tomato paste in the middle ontop of the polenta under the pesto which was a bit disappointing. The pesto was nice and herbaceous and I loved the salad underneath to help complement the polenta. I don''t recall any strong goat cheese flavour and this dish was very filling for an appetizer.1.50$ Bread (5/5)The bread was fucking amazing. The crust was so crispy and fragrant with herbs and cheese and the bread was so soft and delicate homg. droolzzzBraised Boneless Beef Short Rib w/ Root Veg & Navy Beans (3/5)Maybe I didnt have enough of it to judge it as I only had a bite? But it was pretty decent; the beef was cooked perfectly to be honest with you and the flavour of the sauce and the vegetables together made it a really nice hearty, earthy dish but I don''t think I could finish this as it would get too boring for me.Pumpkin Seed Crusted Salmon w/ Mango & Smoked Red Pepper Salad (4.5/5)This was the best flavour trip I''ve went on for an itallian restaurant. The contrasting textures of the crunchy seeds, crispy yet chewy skin, flaky but moist salmon, slightly crunchy mangoes, soft red peppers. It was a thrill eating this. The flavours of all the components complimented each other ALOT and I would I highly recomend this dish to anyone to try. The only reason why I knocked half a star was because there was a minimal amount of red pepper salad when there could''ve been more because I didn''t notice any red pepper until halfway into eating the salmon that I noticed it.Warm Banana Chocolate Pudding (4/5)I really liked this and I wish it was hotter and I wish I knew what that white sauce was, it was such good comfort food as a dessert.Flourless Chocolate Cake (5/5)Me and my friend loved this cake it was so moist yet so fluffy, melt in the mouth even and the blueberry reduction made it perfect!

Glad to report that it was worth the wait.We arrived promptly at 7:00 and the place was almost empty (although it did fill up as we were eating). We were shown to a sweet table right by the window and instantly served glasses of water and complimentary bread. Good start so far.For our appetizer, we decided to share an order of the Prosciutto Rolls ("w/arugula, goat cheese, and figs"). The dish came with two such rolls and they were indeed tasty, although they did feel as though they belonged at an ''80s themed dinner party.For my main, I went with the Skirt Steak ("w/onions and gorgonzola"). I really, really enjoyed this. The steak was cooked perfectly (despite the cut being a little on the chewy side), and the accompanying onions-and-gorgonzola sauce was just about perfect. I also ordered a side of Brussels Sprouts and Bacon, and they were fine.

We went there for Winterlicious yesterday and it was an complete disappointment.Service: extremely slow, over 20 minutes between the courses, not friendly, inexperienced (stacking empty dishes right at the table).Ambiance: we had a table by the window. It was cold there! The decor was nice but it was way too dark inside for my liking.Food: mot as advertized on Winterlicious menu and presentation for all dishes looked extremelly SLOPPY. Like a little kid was arranging them on plates.I had Roasted Beet Salad with Scallion Dressing and Toasted Pumpkin Seeds - a few pieces of beets and scallions pretty much no pumpkin seeds - no flavours - complete disappointment.For main, I had Pumpkin Seed Crusted Salmon with Mango and Smoked Red Pepper. Salmon was overdone. Luckily, I do like overdone salmon but was served on a tiny salad plate - probably the portion was very small. There was little mango and a couple of tiny sad pieces of smoked red pepper in the dish and a LOT of lettuce. Definitely, not as advertized.For dessert, I had Flourless Chocolate Cake (vegetarian). Probably, the best part of the meal but the presentation was very uninspiring.Overall, the food tasted very meh. I can probably cook the same stuff better at home.I am guessing that this restaurant cheaps out on Winterlicious menu, which is unfortunate because I am definitely not going to recommend anyone to go there. Take your money elsewhere. Skip Five Doors North.');

The just of it is that a Canadian man went on a trip to Northern Thailand, ended up meeting his future wife and moved with her back to Canada. Chef Nuit and her husband opened several restaurants with the goal of duplicating authentic Thai cuisine. When we arrived on a weeknight the line was out the door, but once we made it to the host stand our wait was only about 15 minutes. The menu is very thoughtful - some of the traditional Thai dishes such as Pad Thai and Tom Yum Shrimp and others that I had not seen before. I can see why the place is so popular - the flavors were outstanding in the handful of dishes we were able to sample!');

The Ambiance:The ambiance is pretty cool and this place is much bigger than it looks. It is underground and they have tables with beach umbrellas and the vibe makes you feel like you are above ground. The Service:The service has pros and cons. We were seated at the bar relatively quickly with how busy the restaurant was. We placed our orders and saw people around us who ordered after us receiving their food. We waited over an hour for our food until I said something to an employee. They went to the kitchen to check on our orders and came back with our dishes which were now cold. I''m pretty sure they were forgotten in the kitchen and just sitting there. My friend sent hers back and I just ate mine since I was famished at this point. My friend had to send her dish back 2 more times before it came back at a decent temperature. My dish was just Luke warm. The Food:I ordered the green curry dish. It was really spicy and really flavourful. It is served in a real coconut, which makes it pretty cool since you can also eat the coconut meat. The dish was like warm and didn''t come with enough vegetables. I wish the waitress told me that I could have added vegetables to my dish when I placed the order. I was told about this after I ate my meal and I then placed an order for a side of steamed vegetables due to my food allergies. My friend ordered the an ox dish and she found it way too fatty and extremely cold. She was not a fan!Would I return?Possibly but I would opt to try other restaurants before going back here.');

I believe the level of spice is predetermined now whereas in the past you were allowed to choose your level. As such it''s not as spicy, but still has a good kick. The coconut taste blends well. There is a healthy portion of eggplant.The portion is great -- the steamed rice soaks in the curry sauce very well. You could almost have another bowl of rice to indulge yourself.');

The food isn''t absolutely terrible, but I''ve had better Thai food elsewhere. When I was eating there I was super hungry so everything tasted really good and I wolfed it all down...but when I think back it was only good because I was so hungry. The oxtail was okay but there was barely any oxtail in it. They use a big bowl to make it seem like a bigger portion but it''s really not that much and for $16, not really worth it. The pad thai was just okay...it wasn''t very flavorful and it was kind of dry. The Khao Soi was very heavy tasting and also didn''t come with a lot of stuff in it. The chicken wings were pretty good but nothing special. Chill place and vibes, but I found the food very average overall and expensive for the portions.');

The restaurant is a lower level type restaurant.There was a along line going down the stairs to just put your name on the wait-list. We contemplated leaving but we decided to head straight to the take out area instead.  For a Asian restaurant to play urban music and reggae music was quite interesting.  It had a nice Caribbean vibes (Welcome to the 6ix!)We ordered two Pad Gra Prow, one chicken and the other with shrimp served w/ (steamed jasmine rice, thai style fried egg, nam price nam pla sauce).

Pad Thai - we ordered it spicy but it usually isn''t. Spice works. The level "Thai spicy" is legit! Acceptable for those than can handle it. Yum!! They also accommodate and remove nuts if you''re allergic.

INSERT INTO review_info(Restaurant_Name,Review) VALUES ('Pai Northern Thai Kitchen','Why have I not written a review for Pai yet! Let me hop on that bandwagon and get in on that hype. Discretion: My review is entirely based on the food alone since I have never dined in. I cannot comment on the service. Needless to say, Pai is amazing. I have had it multiple times (doesn''t help that we live literally right above it), and they have been consistent every single time. There''s no one experience that fell short for us. I have never actually dined in yet, since the line is ridiculous and I live right by it, but ritual/take out never failed once. It is probably one of the best thai restaurants, if not, the best one so far in Toronto.  Food wise, I think most of us would agree that this place serves delicious authentic thai food. Having been to both northern and southern Thailand, the food at Pai is as authentic as can be (but obviously at a much more inflated price, which is understood). THAI CHICKEN WINGS - juicy plump wings and very well seasoned. A great starter! GAI SATAY - can never go wrong with satay. LAAP SALAD - the minced pork is marinated very well. It is a very nicely paired dish with the sticky rice. And there''s something in her sticky rice that is quite addictive. PANANG BEEF CURRY - no complaints, absolutely delicious. PAD GRA PROW - One of my go-tos. It hits the spot every time. The rice is delicious, the minced beef is so well-seasoned. The combo is a killer, and I love it! KHAO SOI - Hat off to the authenticity of this dish. It tastes exactly the same as the ones I''ve had in Changmai. The only one complaint I have is that there isn''t enough egg noodles!  The coconut milk in the curry makes the soup so incredibly addictive. CHEF NUIT PAD THAI - also one of their staples. There is a very good balance with the tanginess and sweetness in the sauce. The noodles are stir-fried just enough that it is not too dry nor too wet. It is really so so good! Pai nails every dish every time even on our take out orders. This is a restaurant that I recommend to all my friends who are visiting from out of town. Keep up the great work Pai!');

I got here on a Saturday morning exactly at 11:30am when they opened and there were already a handful of tables filled up. By 12pm, the restaurant was almost full. The decor gave me local Thailand vibes so the place looked like it was going to be authentic. I got the chicken pad thai and I guess I had super high expectations coming into this restaurant because of the reviews. Sadly, it didn''t meet my high expectations. While the noodles were cooked very well, the use of oyster sauce was a bit overwhelming. For appetizers, the satay was average, but if there''s anything you need to get, it''s the breaded garlic shrimp!!! Overall, the food was good and I enjoyed my meal, but it didn''t blow my mind like I had expected!');
INSERT INTO review_info(Restaurant_Name,Review) VALUES ('Pai Northern Thai Kitchen','Let me just start by saying this was the best pad thai I''ve ever eaten. Now, I''m not sure how much that is saying considering I''m not an avid Thai food eater; however, this is the best tasting one I''ve ever eaten. The portion was generous and the dish had the perfect amount of sweetness and saltiness. I ordered the Chef Nuit Pad Thai, inclusive of stir fried rice noodles, house-made tamarind sauce, beansprouts, tofu, egg, chives, Thai coriander, fresh lime, home roasted peanuts, choice of chicken, beef or tofu and veggies. The lime adds a nice touch at the end. The cost was either 14 or 15 Canadian dollars. We also ordered the spring rolls, inclusive of deep fried vegetarian rice paper wraps, mushrooms, glass noodles, carrots. sprouts served with sweet and spicy Thai chilli sauce. Those spring rolls were so good. The fried taste of the spring rolls were reminiscent of the egg rolls I ate growing up. The glass noodles and mushrooms certainly made the dish but everything was intentionally combined for the perfect morsel of goodness. The cost of the spring rolls were CA $7.99 or $8.99. I would definitely order the spring rolls and the pad Thai again.The place isn''t that big and the line builds up pretty quickly. I advise going earlier in the primary meal times like 11/11:30am for lunch or 5 or 5:30pm for dinner. These times are ideals for those who do not like confined spaces or want to avoid crowds. If you don''t mind, you may have to wait a fair amount of time before you get seated. The takeout line was pretty long too because it is a very popular place to eat. I also went with a friend that eats vegan and Pai demarcates vegan options on the menu. I thought that was a nice touch!With over 2300 reviews at 4.5 stars, I can confirm that it is worth the hype. I''m not a huge fan of lines but if I pick a good time to go, I''ll certainly go back.');

Thai Spicy Pad Thai was super spicy but still super flavourful. Green Curry in a coconut makes my mouth water just thinking about it. The coconut bowl is a great touch because you get to carve the coconut flesh out as you liked. Yum! The red curry was really good too, but personal preference is almost always green curry.The Sake bombs (4 point play) were super fun. I think Sake bombs were $5 on Saturday when we went.

Everybody that I brought to this place ended up loving it! It''s now a go-to place for my boyfriend and I. I tried a few things from the menu already. This is a review of different menu items during the times that I''ve been to Pai. Starters: Grabong - My favourite starter is the Grabong. It''s a plate of deep fried squash fritters that taste sooooo amazing!!! They only offer it for the dinner menu. I always make sure to order that one whenever I go to Pai for dinner. Spring rolls - also pretty good. Slightly spicy after a few bites.Kung Tawt - deep fried garlic shrimp. You can never go wrong with fried shrimp! This one has a slightly fragrant taste to it. Miang Kung - it looks really pretty and everything but unfortunately it''s not one of the items from Pai that I like very much. This is the one where you use the provided betel leaves and wrap all the ingredients into little wraps. The betel leaves taste were too strong for me. Everything tastes super fresh though. Mains: Khao Soi - highly recommended!!! The fried egg noodles part taste reallly good with the curry. The beef is also very soft.Gaeng Masaman - braised beef in peanut tamarind curry. Another one of my favs from the menu. It''s slightly more spicy than Khao Soi. Chef Nuit Pad Thai - despite the raves about this dish from other reviewers, I actually don''t like this Pad Thai dish as much. I find it slightly more sour than my liking.

Next, we got the Gaeng Kiaw Wan (Green Curry) and the Khao Soi. The curry was served in a coconut with a side of extra curry and rice. Again, the aroma was amazing. The curry was creamy and light. It was really delicious. The Khao Soi was definitely my favourite dish. You are served a massive bowls of noodles in a coconut-curry broth and contains egg noodles topped with fried noodles.

This was my third time getting the Classic Eggs Benny, but this time I also split the Huevos Ranchos with my friend. I love how you can choose strip bacon for the Classic Eggs Benny instead of automatically having pemeal bacon. They are quite generous with the bacon strips and I prefer the crispy texture over the pemeal. The eggs are poached perfectly with the yolk oozing out as you cut. Hollandaise sauce is quite tasty and done well to my liking. It''s doesn''t particularly standout, but it''s goes well with the Benny as a whole. The potatoes here are unlike anywhere else! I believe a BBQ sauce is used for seasoning. The Huevos Ranchos was also great! I love Mexican and anything with guac, which they were very generous with!

Fast forward lika decade and here I am coming here for a date and surprisingly for a thursday night they had space even for two people who didn''t have reservations.ATMOSPHERE (4/5*)Upon entering its very dimlight for 6 pm. The atmosphere was very cozy with a huge bar dedicated for their long list of cocktails. They have a multitude of seat styles where they have regular tables by the entrance, multiple bar seats, a few high tables, and a bunch of lounge chairs at the back. I loved the lighting and the decor as it fits a very casual romantic or friends coming to relax and talk setting. It is quite loud however so you might end up yelling alittle trying to talk to whoever.FOOD (2/5*)Overall it was okay. Very basic food with little to no technique or flavour input. It''s great for something small to eat or order a huge tray of nachos and drinks but if you''re looking for a fulfilling or adventurous meal then this isn''t the place. It''s not that cheap either ranging from the 15s to 25s for meals and they''re not that big or filling. SERVICE (5/5*)We only had one server but boy was she just bubbly, nice, and helpful. I wanted her opinion on the menu about whether I should change the dressing of my salad or which salad and I kinda regret my decision and I wish I picked her recomendation! Maybe it would have been better (it was the quinoa salad). But the blueberry vinegrette was lovely. She was very helpful for dessert too and always refilled our water. I can''t speak for all waitresses but definately they''ve got one you can count on ;)Thanks for having me and maybe I''ll come back for nachos and drinks instead!');
INSERT INTO review_info(Restaurant_Name,Review) VALUES ('Insomnia Restaurant & Lounge','I came to Insomnia recently for dinner and drinks -- in short I''ll say the ambiance is great, the food OK, and the drinks a little pricey. My boyfriend and I each got a fried chicken thigh sandwich ($13), which had so much potential to be good. I don''t know if it was sitting around for a bit before being brought out, but by the time I got it, the bottom bun was completely soggy -- and this girl is not a fan of soggy buns. For the price, the sandwich was on the small side. The combination of ingredients was good though, so I had no problem eating the sandwich first so it didn''t have a chance to get more soggy. Their fries ($7) are a shareable portion and they''re great. My friend got a pasta dish which she enjoyed and it was *huge*, imo, a very shareable portion. They have an pretty good beer selection, and I''ve got to come back to try their cocktails. It''s worth mentioning I came here for brunch a year or so ago and was really impressed by the food. Maybe brunch is this place''s strong suit?The ambiance inside is nice, dimly lit at night with good tunes and quite a bit of seating. Washrooms are down a set of stairs. The service was just ok on the last night I was there, but the place was really busy. I found it odd that our server was very attentive with the table beside us though. All in all, I''d come back here to give their brunch another go or to have a drink or snack.');

INSERT INTO review_info(Restaurant_Name,Review) VALUES ('Insomnia Restaurant & Lounge','My husband and I visit Toronto every year for TIFF; we started coming here for brunch a few years ago and the tradition has continued. Insomnia has been one of the places that I genuinely look forward to visiting. First of all, the vibe of the place is very chill and welcoming. I absolutely love the tree that is part of the decor, as well as the bar and the comfy chairs and tables in the back of the restaurant. It''s also really great that the front windows open so you can feel as if you''re dining al fresco when the weather allows. I have ordered a benedict on every visit, the most recent being the smoked salmon. It makes me so happy that I can get a gluten free benedict because that''s pretty rare in my experience. The gluten free manami curried rice patties are delicious and cooked to be slightly crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. As a self-proclaimed egg connoisseur, I can fully appreciate the perfectly poached eggs that have sat atop my patties. Bennies are accompanied by mixed greens and the best home fries that I have ever had. I don''t know what is in the "legendary sauce" that they are tossed in and it doesn''t matter because it is absolutely magical. Not only do the delicious food (a lot of it being gluten free- like the poutine!), drinks, mimosa brunch special and super cool atmosphere keep us coming back, but the service is fantastic. The servers are friendly and very attentive but never intrusive or pushy. Believe me when I say that I am already excited about coming back next year!');

Prior to giant big box super stores, this is how people bought their groceries and in lots of places, still do.Butchers with counters of beef and pork and chicken. Fishmongers with all sorts of fresh, fileted and prepared fish. Grocers with displays of colorful produce. Nuts, honey, spices, all kinds of great stuff you can shop here and bring home to cook.Of course, no visit to the St. Lawrence Market is complete without a peameal bacon sandwich. Peameal is just pork and peameal bacon is like what you''d have if you took a pork tenderloin and sliced it as thin as bacon, on a sandwich roll. It''s delicious and well worth the stop.The St Lawrence Market is on two floors and gets very crowded during the day time. There is an ATM inside or one across the street. Most vendors do take credit cards but your transaction will probably go faster with cash. Best to visit early and be hungry.[Review 10978 overall, 750 of 2019.]');

Next we went to Buster''s Sea Cove and had their $15 crab cakes with fries, and a clam chowder.  Was expecting the crab cakes to be more flavourful...unfortunately it fell flat for us. Clam chowder was pretty good.  Finally went to Churasco for a Portuguese tart. It was cold and custard was way too sweet.  Can find better options back home (and I''m from Alberta! Yikes!). I hear their BBQ chicken sandwiches are great though.  This might be a good place to grab some groceries if you''re local, but if you''re a tourist looking for some tasty treats, it felt like more of a tourist trap for us than anything. Overpriced and underwhelmed.');

Finding and actually getting to the marker and finding parking was definitely a little challenging however worth it none the less. There are so many great shops and amazing food to try here that I promise anyone will find something here. For me the stand out vendors were the seafood ones that had Oysters that you can pick and have shucked on the spot. This was really great because the employees here really knew there stuff and had recommendations for different flavour profiles. I got to learn that different Provence''s oysters have different tastes and that was really cool. Another stand out for me was the large cheese and deli counter on the second floor where again we were treated amazingly and got to learn more about each slice of meat and the difference in how it''s raised and where they come from. There is so much to eat and sooo many places to check out that if your in the area please check this place out !! You can thank me later ;p');

Expect to have breakfast and lunch or just buy some fresh artisan cheese, produce, seafood, meats, pastries, spices, condiments etc. to whip up for a nice dinner.  They have everything you need to make and compliment your meal.Our first time here, we arrived later in the day, around 4ish on Saturday. The good - it wasn''t crowded at all.  In fact, it was really nice not having to deal with lines and hoards of people.  The experience was calming and enjoyable.  The not so good - some vendors were out of items we wanted to try.  Yet this didn''t detract from our experience.  There is so much you''re going to want to taste and I doubt your tummy can handle it all.  So, move on to the next vendor!Upper and lower floors are filled with food options.  I won''t go into detail about various vendors, basically every option & cuisine can be found. Very culturally diverse. The hardest decision is figuring out what you want to try.  Check out website prior to visiting.  The peameal bacon sandwich is a must get if you''ve never had.  Contrary to my own advice we were only able to handle a few dishes at Buster''s Sea Cove (I''m a sucker for seafood).  My guy loved the lobster roll.  Clam chowder was ok and my assorted seafood orzo was swimming in sauce with not much seafood - wouldn''t recommend.  Great place to buy souvenirs and don''t forget the famous maple syrup.  Many or all vendors are cash only.  If you forgot your Canadian cash, they accept American $ dollar for dollar.  Closed on Sundays.  Parking is rough here especially on weekends.  Expect to find a spot a few blocks away.  Farmer''s Market open on Saturdays and Antique Market on Sundays. Allow yourself at least an hour or two to get the full experience.  I found myself a little overwhelmed the first time here. My advice to you?  Check out the website / vendors first and come with a plan and appetite.');

She had a difficult trying to pick out what exactly she wanted. In the end she picked the Tasca, a stuffed Agnolotti. It was one big Agnolotti or Agnolotto? not sure on the terminology. I''ll speak to my pizza first. The pizza was of a nice thin crust, good cook on the dough, the toppings were good. The cheese isn''t very strong, especially not against the Nduja sausage. It''s spicy tanginess highlight the pizza, along with the slight oiliness it from the rendered fat of the sausage. The basil, was probably the thing that balances out the pizza. I kind of wish there was more, but the pizza still hit some powerful profiles on my palate. The thinness of the pizza and the cripsy and chewiness of the dough made easy to devour the whole things without making it seem too heavy.  The Agnolotti was pretty good. The mix of the cheese and vegetable along with the sauce made for a creamy and smooth mouthful. It wasn''t something I would normally get for myself, but I''d consider it next time. I don''t have so much to say about this restaurant. The food was good but in my opinion, it doesn''t change my mind all that much about pastas or Italian food.

My husband ordered the Striploin with a side of mushrooms which came in a very good portion size and tasted excellent. He also ordered a side of horseradish creme fraiche. I was very surprised to see that they charge $5 for a very small side of this. For what it is, it should have been included with the steak or worked into the price of the steak. Just seems embarrassing to charge $5 for it.I enjoyed the Pan Roasted Halibut & Fogo Island Shrimp. The meal was perfectly cooked and full of flavour. I would be happy to order this meal again.For dessert we shared the Assorted Ice Cream Sandwiches. It''s basically 3 different types of ice cream stuffed between 3 house made cookies. Nice cold dessert. Warning: Very messy dessert choice. Do not recommend if you''re on a date ;)');

I was told that I had to get the Tasca- and I am so glad that I did! It''s a pasta filled with ricotta, spinach, mushrooms and brie, smothered in a creamy tomato sauce. Usually I don''t like too much cheese, but this pasta is AMAZING! I am so excited to come back and try other things (although I''ll probably still order the Tasca and make my boyfriend get something else so I can try it). This time, him and my other friend both ordered pizzas. The pizzas were average but nothing amazing. So definitely get pasta if you''re coming to this restaurant. I couldn''t stop talking about how much I enjoyed dinner and how good the Tasca was- so my boyfriend already expects that we will be returning very, very soon. Even while I was eating it I was craving for some more, but I was too full to eat any more. It doesn''t look filling when it comes, but it really is.For an appetizer, we got the mussels in white wine sauce. The sauce is delicious, especially if you dip the bread in it. Will be back soon!!');

My pasta dish was really good, but everything else was meh. We walked in and were seated by the door, odd. There was no one else in the restaurant. The server brought over bread and butter (the bread was rock hard). We ordered our drinks, and decided to go for the Caesar salad and the Nato Pizza (pepperoni, peppers, and mushrooms. The salad was basic with huge leaves of lettuce (annoying) and home-made croutons - no bacon :( The pizza was ok, the dough was good but the toppings were not cooked and overall was a very average tasting pizza. We had all ordered pasta as our mains. I thought mine was the best. The Penza was Rigatoni with vodka, spicy pancetta (cured bacon), green onions & a touch of chili pepper. It was all cooked in a creamy tomato sauce. I thought the Creamy tomato sauce was good (it could have used more salt). Usually creamy sauce gets very heavy and tomato sauce can get kind of boring but this was great. The pasta was a bit undercooked which was annoying. The spicy pancetta was great, added a good texture to the dish. Overall I would go back if I was in the area but wouldn''t make a special trip. Keep Eating, Angela');

The Basta is an absolute must order. The pasta is so fresh and delicious and the cream sauce and shrimp perfectly complete the dish. The baked goat cheese salad is another epic menu item. The goat cheese is baked in filo so this is a richer salad - you can share to take away 50% of the guilt but you probably want it all for yourself. We also had the chocolate brownie cheesecake which was a solid 4 and the Tasca pasta which was good but paled in comparison to the Basta.');

Well the staff here really don''t care much about your enjoyment because on multiple moments it felt like they were pressuring us to a)order something b)pay c)wrap up. They didn''t really refill our water and just kept on asking us if we were finished.Onto the one thing that really ticks me off when I go out to eat: wait staff that bring the receipt/bill to you without you asking for it first. That is exactly what they did to us. So ya thanks we got the hint. We won''t be coming back. Not worth the price or worth enduring the crappy service.

INSERT INTO review_info(Restaurant_Name,Review) VALUES ('Hibiscus','Hibiscus has been a fixture at Kensington Market for many years. The restaurant is small, with a tiny patio at the front. Decor is simple but nice and clean.My favorite savoury crepe is the Brie Cheese Pecan (made with vegan buckwheat batter, served with greens, zucchini and avocado). The flavor is light, and the beautiful presentation is a bonus.For dessert, I enjoy ordering the Homemade Chocolate Hazelnut Spread Banana (made with vegan buckwheat batter, served with icing sugar and maple syrup). The chocolate hazelnut spread is a bit on the bland side, but I believe it is healthier than the commercial product which is loaded with sugar. Again, the nice presentation adds to the enjoyment of the dish.Once I had  their vegan ice cream and it was very good. I was informed that it was prepared using coconut milk.

The salad has a variety of quality and fresh ingredients including kale, rice noodles, carrots, quinoa, squash, nuts and tofu.

The price was fairly high (about $20) for what is essentially a medium-sized pizza. However, the ingredients certainly justify the price. The mushrooms and the ricotta cream were quite tasty. Although it''s not as healthy of a lunch option, the kale on top made it feel like I was making good life choices :). What I liked the most was the crust on the pizza.

It sounds delicious in theory -- truffle, mushroom, kale, cheese -- what could go wrong? But, in contrast to the strong flavour of the stinging bee pizza, these flavours were bland and tired.

There are multiple menus: (1) Happy Hour Specials (2) Drink Menu (3) Main Menu. It was actually a lot to take in because we all wanted a little of everything.The hours on the Specials Menu must have been adjusted recently because when our server came she was actually unsure of exactly when the pizza was half off (on the main menu it said after 10PM). Manager confirmed that it has been changed to 9PM (yay!).AMBIANCE: 4/5The restaurant is very dim lit and all tables are hightops which I actually loved. There''s bar and dining seating - we chose dining. The tables are actually far enough apart that I can walk around without bumping into people while they''re seated! There''s TVs placed ALL around the restaurant so regardless of where you''re seated you can see at least 2 screens.FOOD 4/5The food did take around 15 - 20 minutes to arrive but no complaints.We all ordered pizza so I got to try several different ones. The pizzas ARE NOT PERSONAL SIZE. I ate 2 slices and I was FULL. It was almost a medium for comparison.1. Margherita Pizza: This is your basic vegetarian pizza with basil leaves, tomato sauce, & cheese. It is worth ordering it if you enjoy Margherita pizzas elsewhere as the quality is phenomenal.2. Forager Pizza: Mushroom with kale & truffle. Best, best, best pizza of the night. I am absolutely returning for this within the next week or so. The mushrooms are my favorite, the flavoring is amazing. My sister didn''t like the sauce the kale was seasoned with but I didn''t have a problem with it.3. Pesto & Prawn: I was surprised at how much prawn they put on the pizza & they were FULL SIZE. I didn''t like the cheese they used but props for the quality of the pizza.4. Truffle Fries: MUST GET for $4 on special! There is enough to share with the whole table. The fries are crisp and golden - can''t go wrong there. Not sure what sauce they use for dipping but it went great with the pizza crust too.The only downside is they burnt some of the crust on our pizzas.SERVICE: 5/5Overall, the service was great - our server was really friendly.  However, it seemed like the restaurant was understaffed as the several times we did need her, we couldn''t find her to flag her down.

For main, we ordered the burger and the turkey sandwich, which both turned out to be massive. I basically had to share half of my sandwich with my other friend because of how much food there was. I liked the balance of turkey, avocado, bacon, and lettuce (I replaced the tomatoes) in the sandwich.

It seems anything that doesn''t get punched into the POS was just ignored despite multiple conversations. Glasses of water? Nope, after asking twice (once at time of ordering and once when the beers showed up) and sitting with our beers for 10 minutes we had to get up and get those from the bar ourselves.Hot sauce for our pizza? Never did show up despite requesting.Mistakes happen, but we saw our server texting on her phone at a point, and just standing near the kitchen chatting it up with other staff at another point... So it''s hard for me to be sympathetic when the servers just don''t seem to care.That said, the pizza was pretty good.

Given that we chose to come to Grasshopper due to my eating vegan, I ended up feeling pretty bad/guilty by the end of the meal since no one seemed to be enjoying their food (including me). The alternate location has a Japanese curry vegetable bowl that a friend got me when I went the last time, and so when I got to the College Street location and saw that they had a curry bowl with "chick-un" I got pretty excited. I was hoping I could swap out the fake meat for the veggies from the miso bowl, but when I asked the waitress she told me that wasn''t possible (even if I paid extra). Given that they already have the veggies for the miso bowl, I''m not sure why that was an impossibility. I wasn''t interested in breaded and fried "chicken," so I opted for the haru salad with added tofu. When I got my meal I realized that the tofu was also breaded and fried. That was my mistake in reading the menu, but I wish they had options that were not fried. I ended up picking off all of the breading because not only did it make the meal far less healthy, it also didn''t taste good. My dining companions had:-"Chick-un Banh Mi"-Tempeh Sloppy Joe burger-Spicy Black Bean burger-"Pulled Pork" Banh MiMy friend''s daughter who ordered the Sloppy Joe wasn''t happy with the texture or flavor, so that meal went pretty much uneaten.

She went with their Famous Schnitzel and I went with the Austrian Veal version. Each dish comes with one choice of sides: French Fries, Landwer Rice, Couscous, vegetables and for an extra dollar more, Sweet Potatoes Fries.The portion size is good along with the taste of the Schnitzels. They were fried well but it was still juicy and tender in the inside. It just seems having gone to other Schnitzel Restaurant that the plate was empty since it was missing some of the side dishes that we are accustomed to like beets, potatoes salad and sauerkraut.

We got a table for two at 9:30 AM and were seated immediately upon arrival.They have a lot of vegetarian options on the menu and even vegan choices. I opted for the vegan breakfast which was so much fun to eat! So many small dishes, each with unique flavours and spices. It was very filling. I could have easily shared it with someone else and still be full. My friend got their classic shakshuka and she really liked it as well. The service was great, the prices are pretty fair, and the food is amazing. Needless to say, I can''t wait to go back.Did I mention how much I love the decor?');

In retrospect, the qualms I have were mainly due to my lack of knowledge, so I did take that into consideration when writing this review.First off, I must applaud Cafe Landwer once again on their phenomenal service! The cashier who kept taking order after order of the $1 hot drinks was absolutely friendly and sweet through it all. She even asked customers if they''d want pricier hot drinks, as the whole hot drink menu was $1 for the day! Another waitress came by when we were all in line, and kindly offered their freshly baked nutella rugelach. The pastry was so soft, warm, and gooey! It really hit the spot, and the powdered sugar was the ultimate cherry on top. Will definitely order this the next time I come.I asked for the True Mocha with almond milk and dark chocolate. I found the coffee weak and tasteless with my first sip... and there was marginal improvement as I progressed through the drink. Ultimately, I decided to just chuck it in the sink - and only then did I see layers of dark chocolate chips on the bottom! And as my memory cleared up to recall seeing a certain funny-looking drink that was white on top with black boba-like pebbles on the bottom, I clued in to realize that the mocha has real chocolate chips settled at the bottom. Duh! What a waste of a drink that I''m sure would''ve been otherwise fantastic!My colleague got the Nutella Latte and absolutely adored it. He became a fan of Cafe Landwer after seeing and tasting the pastries, and swears that he''ll visit their location in Boston!');

Omg. Just ...!! It came with four tiny pieces of fried halloumi cheese and they were bites of halloumi heaven ! I would recommend ordering extra halloumi because it is soooo worth it !! 2. Mini kebabs . These kebabs came on a bed of eggplant, onions and other grilled yummy vegetable goodness in the centre and all on top of fluffy bread on a pan. It was Flavourful w some tahini sauce!!

Landwer doesn''t take reservations for brunch so my friends and I swung by around 10:30am and we were seated immediately with a few empty tables around. Food-wise, we couldn''t make up our minds because the menu looked so good. Result: order everything!I tried the Sabbich bowl which is eggplant, potatoes, tahini and an egg on top. My friends grabbed the eggplant and tahini. And, we also ordered sides of halloumi, falafel, farmers market cauliflower and Mexico hummus bowl to share. In hindsight, it may have been a tad much but it was all worth trying. Hits:Falafel - probably the best falafel I''ve ever had. Dense, yet moist. You absolutely need to order this! And don''t feel like you need to share either!Hummus bowl - we ordered the Mexico bowl because it came with fried avocado (yes!), but really you can pick from any of the 4 selections and you''d be fine. Sabbich/eggplant in tahini - I would suggest only one of these and for sharing only. There''s a lot of tahini in these dishes and it''s very rich so the dish is best shared. Unless you''re in love with tahini then go for it! Service here was excellent. Coffees refilled, checking in to see how are meals tasted, and even though they were busy with people waiting for tables, we never once felt rushed. One nice thing I noticed was the staff served free coffee to the customer waiting for a table. Given that it was freezing outside I thought this was a very thoughtful gesture.

It came with at least half an avocado, so no small amount! I probably would remove the cheese next time personally. I also got a cortado. They have so many lactose-free options, including lactose-free milk (did not hear oat milk though). They also have a beautiful selection of gf goodies: muffins, cupcakes, cookies, and more. I took an espresso and an orange chocolate cupcake to go (I think both are dairy-free). Having light, decadent gf cupcakes is hard to do and they were on point!  Phenomenal!

I got two cupcakes for my friend and I: lemon vanilla and the carrot cake. The yelp reviews tell me that their cupcakes have a lot of promise but their carrot cake cupcake is actually UNBELIEVABLE. With a moist carrot cake base with a creamy but not too sweet frosting, the balance and combination blEW ME AWAY. My friend also enjoyed her cupcake. I''m already so excited to try their other cupcakes. Also I wanted to get their regular chocolate chip cookie but the customer in front got to it before I did. Service was good but the cupcake was phenomenal!In addition, I also really appreciate how Almond Butterfly takes the care and time to package the cupcakes properly, unlike other cupcake places where I went to where box packaging would result in a damaged cupcake.Update: I returned to get a chocolate CHUNK cookie and the cashier gave me a chocolate CHIP cookie, which was vegan. I wanted a sweet chewy cookie but instead I got a jaw workout with the tough and dry cookie. Their cookie is a 2/5, I really expected better even if it''s vegan.

INSERT INTO review_info(Restaurant_Name,Review) VALUES ('Almond Butterfly Cafe & Bakeshop','I stumbled upon Almond Butterfly Cafe while waiting for a friend for dinner. What distinguishes the cafe from others is its decor.  Adorning wooden panels, naturalistic knick knacks as well as bear and butterfly themed drawings, you will be transported to cottage country once you enter. To top it all off, country pop music plays in the background and it perfectly lulls you to relaxation.  The volume is a little high, so if you''re visiting to study, you will want to bring your headset. Also, the cafe serves vegan and gluten-free baked goods.  You''ll get the full gamut from cupcakes to muffins to brownies to cookies and so forth.  Unlike other shops that serve a similar style of desserts, this cafe actually has decent seating and table space. I would assume that  you could fit up to 8-10 diners at once.  As such, it''s a great choice when you want to grab a bite over coffee and chit chat without having to take the extra step of finding your own space. I''ve been to many shops with vegan/gluten-free fare where it was impossible to dine in, which made it difficult if I wanted seconds or didn''t want to ruin the pastries on my way home.  Here, you won''t have to worry about these unfortunate scenarios. The cupcakes seem to be HGs of the cafe. Most of the flavours seem to be chocolate or vanilla based, but I did spot one lemon variety.  Perhaps I came during a time when there were limited flavours, so you may want to call in beforehand to ask about the varieties they''re serving that day.  I ordered the Almond Butterfly, a vanilla cupcake topped with almond frosting and a sprinkle of what seemed to be crushed berries. Contrary to its looks, the frosting is purely almond flavoured even though it''s pastel pink, the iconical colour for strawberry.  Upon my first few bites, I quickly realized that the cupcake was bomb! The sponge was moist and the frosting was soft and sweet with a good almond kick to it. I do have a few gripes, however.  Firstly, the cupcakes are on the smaller side and are priced about 50 cents to 1 dollar higher than other cupcakes you can find in downtown.  The price to portion ratio is unbalanced with the cupcakes being on the pricier end, but hey, they''re vegan and gluten-free, so there''s some merit to it.  Secondly, the sponge was on the oilier side. I was surprised at how much oil was left on my fingers while I feasted.  It''s expected to get a little oil on your fingers when eating pastries, but I was shocked at how much oil came off of this cupcake. All I can say is to watch the number of servings you''re having if you''re going for a dozen cupcakes (which is actually very likely to happen because these cupcakes are just so dang flavourful!).Would I come back? Perhaps. I''m not much of a cupcake gal, but I do like how the cafe''s located near some cheap eats joints like River Tai and Magic Noodle.  It''s also within a reasonable walking distance of UofT, so it''s a convenient alternative to Starbucks and Tim Horton''s.');

Like many places, drip coffee runs out at noon or so, so Americano''s are what you get after that as a substitute. I had a Bunz meetup here where we sat at a 2 top. It was perfect for that with a size that makes it easy to spot your buddy, and a chill vibe where nobody stares at you as you walk in.In fact after Christmas I was hanging out and random-chatting with both customers in the line and the barista in no time, even before sitting down.That''s always a sign of greatness in any establishment.');

They will sell you the beans but wont grind them for you which makes no never mind to me. They used to do brunch, but still have pastries to snack on.A lot of people come here to study, which is fine, but when there is nowhere to sit and someone is taking up a table for 4 with a laptop it can be a bit annoying. I paid for parking the other day and walked into a full house with just this scenario. I didn''t want to but had to leave :-(They do live music and private events, I would totally consider doing a birthday party or some other event here it is very intimate and the vibe is just right. Oh that''s another thing, the music is always 100% on point! This is probably my favourite hole in the wall bourbon bar and I would give it a 5 if it weren''t for the lack of seating and signage.

Overall if you have additional allergies or aren''t willing to give up dairy in your baked goods, this may not be the place for you. If you are vegan and gluten-free then this is right up your alley.

At this Kensington Market location, there''s also a small freezer in the corner for frozen savoury goods such as pies. On the last couple of trips, got the carmelita square which I suspect was accidentally invented after a couple of employees blendered some of the end-of-the-day treats. The square has fruity and caramel-y flavors with soft and slightly crunchy textures all woven about.Also got the newly resurrected pizza muffin. It disappeared about a year ago or so and was told it was in re-tool mode, much like the Blue Jays are. When I tasted the new one, my feedback was that I liked the powdery "cheese" topping that was absent with the first one, but am not a fan of the very dense bottom which lacked flavor. The first version had a soft texture with tomato-y and cheesy notes. So my suggestion was to take the bottom of the first one and add on the powdered "cheese" from the second one and you''ll have a home run.Rating: 4 Marcus Stroman emotional outbursts out of 5');

Food: Their chili oil is not too spicy and doesn''t take over the flavour of the pizza yet it adds the perfect kick. Their buttermilk fried calamari is one of my personal favourites. The sauce is so unique, you have to try it! Two of the best pizzas there are the margherita and the porscuitto di parma & arugula! Amazing with the chili oil. Space: The interior of this location is very nice and spacious. It has the perfect balance of privacy mixed with openness. Service: The service here is alright. The second time I went, we weren''t acknowledged by the server until around 10 minutes after we had sat down and the restaurant wasn''t busy at all.

Let''s see what we are javing today. My coworkers tell me this place serves the best authentic Italian pizza in Toronto. So naturally I need to give it a try.I ordered the daily special pizza which included cheese, cheese, more cheese, roasted garlic, chard, and sausage. The pizza when I got it looked more like an oval to me, the crust was slightly burnt, and the toppings fell apart when I was cutting it. I''m not Italian and I don''t claim to know what authentic Italian pizza tastes like but I''m pretty sure it shouldn''t taste like a mouthful of burnt crust. The pizza dough was soft and well made but the burnt taste just ruined it for me.This is one of the fancier pizza places I''ve been to. Very good service and no complaints here.The pizza I ordered was around $20. The size wasn''t extremely big but it''s enough to fill one up for the meal. However, for that pricing I wished there was a little more.Maybe it was the hype or maybe I was just served a poor pizza but I didn''t enjoy the pizza as much as I wanted. Hopefully I will have a better experience the next time I visit. And that''s it for today''s episode of javing it with Javier. And remember food is life!');

Their chili oil is a beautiful additional flavoring to any pizza and especially if you have any crust left from the pizza-- should drizzle it with oil. It is not too spicy and just adds a slight hint of pepper kick. I really enjoyed the sausage pizza with the tomato sauce. It is like the margarita pizza but topped with their homemade sausage! We enjoyed our service there because the waiter was very friendly and funny. It was a great environment to dine in a group.');

INSERT INTO review_info(Restaurant_Name,Review) VALUES ('Pizzeria Libretto','I hate giving this place such a "meh" review, but I honestly didn''t think it was over-the-top amazing. While the wood fire pizza was good, we had a few hiccups during our visit here. This place is my friends favorite pizza place in Toronto, and I can see why. They offer salads, wood fire pizzas and delicious-sounding drinks. We went to the location downtown which didn''t have an intimate feel and definitely felt like a "modern" decor type place. The ambiance of this location didn''t reflect the way the menu was set up or how I picture a wood-fire/Italian restaurant to be.We had pretty less-than-stellar service when it came to drinks. A mutual friend ordered a dry gin martini with extra olives, but they kept making her a dirty martini which is not what she asked for. In my mind a dry gin martini should be clear and not cloudy. All she wanted was olives in it, not olive juice, which they kept doing so it was very salty. A dry gin martini should not be salty at all.We ordered some arugula salads and I ordered the Margherita pizza. The food was fine: I don''t want to make it seem like this place was garbage. That isn''t the case. I''ve just had better wood-fire pizza and salad in Ann Arbor and other places. What I will say is the person who delivered our pizzas to the table told me that mine was not up to the chef''s standards so they were remaking mine. I did appreciate that, but it was still pretty lackluster when I got it: soggy and droopy and not very crispy, not a ton of cheese on it, or basil and very heavy on the tomato sauce.I''m not sure I''d go back here, but if I did, I think I want to try a different location to see if it''s different.');
INSERT INTO review_info(Restaurant_Name,Review) VALUES ('Pizzeria Libretto','After catching a movie at the Lightbox, we were in the mood for a nice, hearty dinner. My dinner companion had recently watched a Netflix series about pizza, so Pizzeria Libretto was a no-brainer.We arrived around 7:30 on a Saturday night and the place was predictably crowded, though we were instantly able to snag a spot at the bar. Rather than just order a pizza each, we decided to share a few things:Prosciutto di Parma ("grissini, seasonal accompaniments"): This was simply several slices of prosciutto served with three breadsticks and a small dish of pickled veggies. The prosciutto is pretty amazing and probably ranks among the best I''ve ever had, while the breadsticks and veggies were both quite tasty.Buttermilk Fried Calamari ("Romesco (a red pepper almond sauce)"): The highlight of the meal, this definitely blows most fried calamari dishes out of the water. The calamari themselves were fried perfectly, and the accompanying sauce was so addictive I was sopping up what was left with the complimentary bread (which was, by the way, also quite good). The only complaint with this one was that it wasn''t served as quickly as it should''ve been (i.e. the dish wasn''t piping hot).Margherita ("Tomato, Basil, Mozzarella"): Ironically, the pizza was the weakest dish we ate. The toppings were just so-so and the crust, though pleasingly charred around the edges, was unreasonably soggy the closer you got to the middle of the pizza. For comparison, my dining companion had just returned from a trip to Italy, where he ate a number of Margherita ''zas, and he called this version of the venerable dish "garbage."');

It leads to an underground hub but high enough so that natural sunlight is ample. My office decided to have a farewell lunch here for one of our coworkers. We arrived at around 12:30 and our seating was already waiting with cutlery laid out. We made a reservation beforehand. The restaurant was not busy at all. The staff were friendly in their greeting. We were given the menus however it was three menus for a table of nine. The waitress introduce herself and asked about allergies. The food took a long time to come out despite us ordering beforehand when we made the reservation. It was family style salad. An all green plate full of baby arugula, watercress and topped with chunks of walnut and shaved pear. It was dressed in an oily based dressing. It was alittle on the bitter side. Next came the bread. It was an assortment of three types of bread. My favourite was the herb one. It was served with chilli oil and a balsamic vinegrette that I couldn''t stop licking off the bread. We also had the caprese style tomato and bocconcini cheese side. It was garnished with basil. I was sorely disappointed with the pizza. It reminded me of flatbread, cheese and tomato sauce baked on an ever so thin crust. I felt like I could have made the pizza myself and it would have turned out better. Some of it was also burnt. All the courses had the same flavour theme of cheese, tomato and salad and while one may like the compliments in taste, I did not. All the courses tasted similar. Therefore, the bread was what stood out which is weird considering that it was not the main. The espresso cinnamon gelato was so decant and yummy. One scoop was too little. It was the right hint of espresso. If you ever visit here, this is your best bet for dessert. They accept credit and debit cards.The family style lunch: vegetarian pizza, salad, cheese and tomato, side order of bread and one scoop of gelato costs each of us $16 per person. This is average in my opinion. Overall, I give two stars because of the ambience of this place. For a pizzaeria, I was disappointed with the pizza.');

The miscommunication ruined the whole experience for me. Knowing that the lunch stops at 3pm and that the risotto takes 40 mins to cook. I called in ahead of time to speak to someone around 1:30pm to have my amalfi risotto ready as I was making my way there. I spoke to a server, I informed her that I wanted 1 order of the Seafood risotto for a table of 3 people. I think it was this point where the miscommunication happened. She agreed and said it will be ready for us.We arrived at 2pm, we spoke to the initial server and I asked him about the risotto, that I called in about. And he''s like is it for here or to go? I told him that we were dining in. We were seated and waited for 40 mins. Before the risotto came out. To our surprise they brought us THREE RISOTTO dishes. Mind you, on the menu the risotto dish serves 2 people. At no point in time between 2pm to 2:40pm there was any clarification on the order. So I asked the server and informed him that I only wanted 1. So he fetched the server that I spoke to on the phone. And she insisted that I ordered 3 Risottos. I tried to explain to her that party was not ready to eat 6 peoples portion of risotto.My experience is already ruined at this point. I don''t know why she would think that I would want 6 people amounts of risotto. I could''ve tried other things in the restaurant. The risotto itself looked amazing. So if the food was okay I didn''t mind.Unfortunately the risotto was under-cooked. It had a grainy, sandy texture that stuck to the teeth. I informed my guests, and another one agreed with me. I let the server know, he brought Chef Massimo Renzi tableside and he just told me it was cooked al dente, and that he used carnaroli rice. So know we''re stuck eating extra risotto that was under-cooked. My other friend thought the rice was fine, until he tried the one underneath the top layer. I''m assuming that the chef probably tasted that top layer and thought the other rice cooked as well. The seafood in the risotto was perfectly cooked but the dish was spoiled under-cooked rice. I think ultimately the experience was ruined when I got 3 Risottos instead of 1. Which caused the quality of control to go down on the rice. You will see in the photos that you can see the centre of the rice. Which is an indicator that the rice was raw.');

Simple, easy, fast and tasted good if you want a quick summary of my experience.Honestly the only reason why we walked in was because my friend thought it was woodoven baked pizzas buuuuut that was not the case. Just a regular oven built big and looked similar to a woodoven one. Regardless, we still tried their pizzas out. It''s a small shop so don''t intend to go with a group bigger than 5 people otherwise you will probably invade half their tables and/or store, no joke!We got the Marguerrita pizza and a "Craft Your Own" pizza and their pizza sizes were good for one person per pizza. Pretty filling depending on the toppings you had. Taste was great, soft and a bit charred at the crust but toppings and everything came together well. I actually went a bit crazy with the toppings and didn''t think of it like a pizza at the time I was deciding what to put on it so I definitely dealt with the consequences later on. Nonetheless everything still tasted good!If I ever crave and want some quick pizza, this is a place I''d return to if I was in the area.');
INSERT INTO review_info(Restaurant_Name,Review) VALUES ('Pi Co','We went to the original location of Pi Co. which was at Bay and Bloor (right in the heart of Toronto).The process at Pi Co. worked exactly like at Blaze Pizza: you pick the dough you wanted, then the pizza sauce, cheese, and unlimited toppings for a set price.  There were a good number of people dining in here when we arrived.  They have two tables and some stools for dine-in, but it seemed like a lot of people opted for take-away orders.We shared a Craft Yours Pizza.  We chose a regular dough, with some Crushed San Marzano Tomatoes sauce, followed by four types of cheese -- blue cheese, goat cheese, fior di latte, and parmesan -- followed by a good helping of vegetables like basil, sun-dried tomatoes, and then bacon and ground sausage.  Then our pizza was thrown into the 1,000-degree oven for 90 seconds for a classic Neapolitan pizza style. It was a very, very quick cooking process.  After paying for the pizza at the cashier and waiting just a few seconds, I saw the staff bring out our pizza from the oven, plop it into a pizza box (we asked for it to-go), and cut it up for us.  Ninety seconds was incredibly fast and thus there was practically zero wait time from start to finish.Even as I was watching the staff assemble our pizza together by throwing on the toppings that we selected, I felt that he wasn''t as generous as the staff were at Blaze Pizza.  I also felt that the male staff threw all of the toppings into the centre part of the pizza and didn''t scatter them out evenly.  This made for a potentially lop-sided pizza where not every bite had the substantial toppings to taste.  (Although I could have asked the male staff to add more ingredients in if I felt like there wasn''t enough, the staff at Blaze Pizza in comparison put down a lot of generous toppings without asking.  The customized pizza at Blaze Pizza also costs less at $10.)I also noted that our pizza was quite burnt in two places on the top and also on the bottom.  I know that it must be hard to judge the pizza''s cooking time especially since they have other orders in the 1,000-degree oven too but these were the things I noticed.In terms of taste, I really liked the chewy thin crust of the pizza.  What I didn''t like were the underwhelming number of ingredients and burnt parts.');

It just tasted carcinogenic to be perfectly honest.I also felt that they kind of skimped on the tomato sauce, but that could be because I like my sauce on the heavier side.There are a lot of reviewers raving more about their custom pizzas rather than the margherita pizza, so perhaps that''s what I should''ve gotten instead.Nevertheless, I don''t think I would come back for their margherita, but I would be willing to give their custom pizza a try.');

The pizza''s thin crust helps stave off the guilt so you can totally eat a whole pizza without feeling bad. There''s a good selection of toppings.I think the process would be smoother if the pizzas went to a ''finishing'' station before paying, where you can choose to put your arugula or balsamic vinegar etc. on after cooking.');

They have great flavour in their foods however I found the portion sizes rather lacking. I ordered a lunch which consisted of a soup, a piece of corn bread (amazing) and a stuffed pepper. The rice in the pepper was still cold in the middle when it was served to me which meant it was likely reheated. Additionally the rice was dried out. That was disappointing.

They are a farm-to-table restaurant with a casual atmosphere, no pretentious vibes at all! Their focus is on the ingredients, as opposed to relying on sauces or additives for flavour, allowing the fresh ingredients to shine. This is especially obvious, in my opinion, in their salads.I thought everything we tried was delicious but my favourites were the grilled rare tuna - very fresh and paired nicely with the fresh pesto - and roasted sweet potato, which was smooth and tasty, and is one of my go-to side dishes. Finally, I think we all thoroughly enjoyed the ham hock stew, which as my friend says, smells like Thanksgiving in a bowl. Hearty and homey, perfect for enjoying on your own or in the company of close friends or family.

The interior is very clean, modern and with a rustic touch from the wooden table tops and accents. They also have cute outside seating. I ordered the hay roasted chicken, which comes with chimichurri sauce. For my two sides, I chose roasted sweet potatoes and Farm''r salad greens. The chicken with the chimichurri sauce was very delicious. The bite of vinegar from the sauce and the freshness of the herbs made for a tasty accompaniment to the poultry. Unfortunately, I think the chicken was already cooked ahead of time and reheated. I found the portion of chicken to be a bit small. The generous portion of roasted sweet potatoes were tender, seasoned and spiced very well. The greens were fresh and lightly dressed with some oil and vinegar - this was simple but well done. As alluded to above, after the plate, I was still hungry, so I ordered the grilled asparagus and fennel salad. This was not worth an additional $3.50. There was barely any asparagus and it was too charred to eat. The asparagus pieces were chopped very small which made it hard to take off the char.

Last time I tried their weekend brunch and found the prices and portions very reasonable, and the flavors and nutritional value to my satisfaction. Dinner tonight was again 5/5 - the portion sizes were much bigger than I expected for takeout and I was genuinely surprised because previous Yelp reviews reflected the opposite! I ordered the Classic (usually $12.99, but Ritual discount right now!) and the small Farmr platter ($10.99). My favorite side was the roasted cauliflower with pear and almonds (vegan)! It''s actually served cold and the slightly crispy cauliflower plus vinaigrette and sweet notes from the pear work so well together! The seasonal veggie slaw btw probably contains dairy in the dressing I''m sure, since it''s so creamy. The vegetarian lentil chickpea protein patties were hearty, but flavor-wise very bland and they were so dry... Disappointing. The beets/feta/pumpkin seed salad was faultless and has a wonderful slightly creamy, melt-y overall texture from the cheese.

For me, that''s always a good thing to see Mom n dad''s with their little ones enjoying weekend brunch. The whole place is cozy. They mafe use of every space possible. Best part is their booth/ table for 5 with a seating bench with pillows. The servers were very lovely, greeted us with a smile. This place offered Vegan, Gluten Free, and Vegetarian dishes. We ordered the avocado Benedict, sexified. And that means it''s served with the eggs on top of the hash, the tortilla chips in the middle of the plate and the salad looking like a smile. Making the whole dish look like a smiling face. We also had the Spicy Mexican, which is the jalapeño and cheese omelette over the top of tortilla chips, served with Pico de Gallo guacamole and sour cream. Everything we are was good and tasty. Why does this place not get a 5 star? For this reason, soon as we were done with the meals, another server came up and delivered us the bill. Made me feel like we were getting rushed out of there.

INSERT INTO review_info(Restaurant_Name,Review) VALUES ('YAYA Leslieville','The name of the restaurant came from "YaYa Sisterhood", a place for friends to gather and catch up. It came from her own practice of gathering with her girlfriends on a monthly basis and catching up over food. Funny enough the name has come full circle and the owner said that she is also now a Yaya in life, Greek for grandmother.  The owner is a licensed dietitian who created the menu to be healthy and delicious, using farm fresh and local ingredients. There are items available for all of your diets and potential food restrictions. Although I usually wouldn''t order a vegan dish myself I did try a bite of the Vegan Avocado Benedict and it was actually excellent. Such bright flavours - the combination of the fresh avocado, potato, and spinach were perfect together. I have to say though, my favourite dish is the Stuffed French Toast. It gets a 5/5 - it is the best that I have had in Toronto. For some reason french toast seems to be hard to make?...all of the ones I''ve had before were too dry or too eggy, but YaYa''s french toast was so soft, so fragrant with the scent of cinnamon and vanilla, perfectly balanced between sweet and savory with a hint of egg. The challah bread is stuffed with a mixture of mascarpone and ricotta flavoured with vanilla bean and lemon lime zest. The fluffy creamy texture of the mascarpone was everything! I think the challah bread makes a huge difference in the texture of the french toast (it''s thick and soft and has a crust on the outside) and the flavour of the vanilla and lemon give the dish a gourmet character....Nom Factor - 4/5 overall (5/5 for the challah french toast)Price - $16 french toast, $14 avocado benedict (& Vegan benny), $12 potato egg poutine');

It boasts using farm fresh and local ingredients. Sounds good! A quaint place with a raised seating area by the window. What made me love this place was the TV with a fireplace on the screen. A little corny, but still kinda awesome. I cannot say no to Eggs Benedict($14) or coffee($2), so the choice was easy. The coffee was a little strong, but good. Organic and fair trade, of course! Brunch arrived looking fabulous. After my plate''s quick photo session, I dug in, but did not anticipate this little surprise; the yolk was bright ORANGE. Confused, I tasted it and it tasted like egg yolk, but certainly looked like it had come from a psychedelic chicken.We asked about the yolk and they don''t know why it''s orange. She said the owner picks up the eggs fresh every day directly from the farm. They assume because the chickens are grain fed all organic feed, that it affects the colour. Interesting. I feel like I should''ve seen orange yolk in my 30-something years of eating eggs.  It all tasted fantastic, regardless of the freaky looking eggs. The housemade hollandaise sauce was perfect; not full of salt, just creamy goodness. The peameal bacon didn''t even need a knife. So good! The homefries and greens were also very good.  It was refreshing to be at a restaurant all organic/free range/fair trade that wasn''t insanely expensive. The prices were comparable to restaurants that were not organic. This just shows that organic doesn''t HAVE to cost more, Yaya''s proved it. Would love to go back!

I definitely wouldn''t be able to come here everyday on a student budget but I''ll treat myself every once in a while and I''d be more than happy to recommend to others.');

I love the option of being able to customize everything that goes into the bowl, from the base (noodles, salad etc.) to the veggies and choice of protein. When you purchase a box, you also have the option of buying their drinks for a discounted price. The hot peanut sauce is delicious, and goes well with the curried tofu. The staff is also very friendly in answering any questions that the guest may have. I highly recommend this place for a fast lunch. The portion is also a good size, and keeps you full. The shop is also quite clean.');

This little restaurant doesn''t seem like much from the outside, but the food more than makes up for any lack of ambience.The fire alarm went off while my partner and I were the only ones in the restaurant and the woman serving us, who seemed to be managing everything alone, came out and waved a tea towel underneath it. While some people might not have appreciated that, I loved it! It gave it a really homey feel. The food though!!! I ordered the Meat and Vegetable Platter which came with plenty to feed three people. Though you might need extra injera which was offered readily. The beef was cooked to perfection and the lentil dishes were all distinct, being spicy or more subtly flavourful. I really enjoyed the variety on the platter and had a lot of fun scooping it up with the injera.');
INSERT INTO review_info(Restaurant_Name,Review) VALUES ('Lucy Ethiopian Kitchen','What a great first experience trying Ethopian food!! Went on a Thursday night around 7. The owner sat us and left us with the menu.Knowing absolutely nothing about Ethiopian food, the choices were a little daunting at first but the descriptions provided enough information to allow me to make a choice. We also asked the owner a few questions about the menu. I finally settled on the Key Wat but with lamb instead of beef. The owner said this was a spicy sauce based dish.We went downstairs and washed our hands, a must since we were about to eat with our hands, the traditional way. When the food came out, my dish smelled absolutely delicious. It was a deep red spicy sauce and the lamb was so tender. I loved finally having a dish where I wasn''t familiar with all spices and seasonings. Now injera, I think I''m in love lol. If you love the texture of pancakes/crepes you will love injera. I took the extra injera we were served home and ate it with nutella lol. Blasphemous I know, but sooo good!! It really is a perfect "bread".Overall, this was a great introduction to Ethopian food and I would highly recommend Lucy Ethopian Kitchen for your next injera fix.');

The owner was clearly entertaining family or friends when I visited, and for the first 5-10 mins I wasn''t even given a menu or a glass of water. Afterwards, unless she was going to and from the back to get something for the family/friends table, I wasn''t able to flag her down to order or get more water. Sadly, due to this service I will not be coming back. Also, the lamb had way too many bones and had very little meat. But all the other dishes in the vegetable and meat platters were quite tasty. Since Danforth has a plethora of good Ethiopian restaurants, I would recommend you give one of those a try. You''re not missing much here.');
INSERT INTO review_info(Restaurant_Name,Review) VALUES ('Lucy Ethiopian Kitchen','I think this restaurant needs to kick it up a few notches regarding their cleanliness. The bathroom I went into was gross and had no soap. We had initially intended to eat but I was turned off by the bathrooms so I figured we would just get coffee. When we first got here there was a cloud of smoke from the incense that they burn during the coffee service. It is quite overpowering and the 3 of us smelled like that for the whole day. I didn''t like that at all. We ordered the coffee. For coffee it took quite sometime, but that was because they were roasting the beans! I thought that was pretty cool. We got cups that were cold and wet, which led me to believe they had belonged to the guests before us who also had coffee service. Wondering if they were cleaned properly because they didn''t go through a dishwasher. Coffee service ($10) comes with popcorn, which is a nice touch, we were hungry after all, but the popcorn was in a knit bowl--the bowl was literally made of yarn. That doesn''t seem too sanitary to me, and it''s unlikely you can wash a bowl like that. How would you? Dishwasher? Laundry washing machine? I''m pretty sure that yarn bowl has seen hundreds of hands without passing through a method of cleaning. If a restaurant grosses 3 people out so much they decide to get just coffee instead of eat food there, and even the coffee service grosses them out, then I think it''s time to pick it up a bit. I would''ve 1-starred it but the service was friendly. The coffee service was quite a neat experience where they roast the beans in front of you. They also burn incense which I thought was neat but I didn''t like smelling like it afterwards. Would''ve been better to do something like that outside on a patio. The coffee itself was quite mediocre but the experience was interesting.I really think they have the potential to do well, just gotta gravely increase their cleanliness standards. There is a level of cleanliness Toronto restaurant goers have come to expect and unfortunately this place doesn''t make the cut.');

My beau wanted Mac & Cheese for sure, so I opted for the Eggplant Burger. They were promoting their Pink Mac, which was basically any Mac & Cheese with beets juice and cashew cheese sauce added. Ooh it sounded so tempting to me that I asked my beau if it would be ok to add the beets juice on his Mac & Cheese, so that we both can try it out. My beau agreed and he chose the Mac Pac so that he can sample three different flavours at once.My friend ordered their Portobello (mushroom) Burger with sweet potato fries, which came with spicy mayo dip.Service was incredibly fast and they had all three meals within 10 minutes or so of ordering. Very generous portions for fries and their burgers and Mac & Cheese were on the smaller side, but still filling enough for all 3 of us. I had a bite of everything and i almost cried at how delicious the VEGAN Mac & Cheese was!!All their fries were peppered and has herbs such as arugula added to it. My friend''s portobello burger was incredibly juicy and everything tasted healthier than most other ''junk'' food in comparisons!I do not usually eat burgers much less Mac & Cheese, but I would definitely come back!! The fact that my meat-eating beau and friend both devoured their meals meant a great deal to me. They were skeptics at first, but they ended up loving my recommendation!!I really like how they promote a healthier diet that is better for humans, the environment, and animals alike.

Everything is very ... white and sterile looking, not super cozy, it doesn''t have much of a personality on the inside. It''s fairly cute (we got the window seat with the pillows, score!) overall. The menu itself is fairly small. They have 4 burger variations, 4 Mac and cheese variations along with several other small sides and drinks to choose from. Partner chose the mushroom Mac and cheese while I chose the onion and garlic Mac and cheese with a side of fries to share. The Mac and cheeses were awesome! We really loved them and the noodle choice (this is important, people!). I wish I could have ordered a large size but I had to keep my portion small because we had a lot of walking around to do after. The fries were underwhelming. They''re really really thinly cut and a lot of them were soooo hard and crispy. Not a fan at all. We also ordered their house made lemonade and a cider. The lemonade was delicious and so so refreshing, but the glass was pretty dirty and had stuck on food on the inside. These really aren''t things that I care much about but someone else might!

The option to order in advance and eat in using a non take out container would be a nice option for the environment.Third comment, ritual app does not allow for much order customization, like sweetness of the grapefruit soda or listed ingredients like real juice or juices grapefruit, real lemon or lemon juice and so ordering at this location can be a challenge and you may have to call in.  Would be nice to find a balance to that without clouding the app menu with too many words and click thru options.');

Vegan food!I was introduced to PARKA FOOD at first time on the Elite Yelp Event "Nauti By Nature V."  I tried only the Truffle Mushroom MAC.  So, this was my second time having a proper dinner at the Parka Food restaurant! The name PARKA comes from the meaning of a cozy Winter Jacket Parka and the Nature of Park.  I didn''t catch what Parka means in the beginning.  Though, it was very obvious!  When you combine the two words "PARK + PARKA" together, it describes their food as "NATURAL COMFORT."   They intend to transform their fresh vegetable ingredients to be healthy & delicious COMFORT FOOD.  Everything they serve at Parka Food is 100% vegan, plant-based, and free of all animal products, except the desserts.  They get those sweets delivered from local bakeries. FOODThey have different kinds of Veggie Burgers, MAC, Soup and Side Dishes.  They also offer Gluten Free Option.  Isn''t it great?  Let''s me start with my most favourite items on the menu. 1) TRUFFLE MUSHROOM & GARLIC ONION MAC (4.5/5)It was a combination of two MAC dishes between Truffle Mushroom & Garlic Onion.  It was delicious!  I tried their Truffle Mushroom MAC on the Boat Cruise Yelp Event before, but it was different from the one I had at the restaurant.  The one on the Boat event was sour.  I wasn''t sure if it was because the food sat on the boat for too long or because of other reasons.  I prefer to eat at a restaurant, especially for MAC.  I''m sure that MAC is perfect for eating when it''s just finished!  PARKA MAC is a good choice for vegan and people who are lactose tolerant. *** The CREAMY VEGAN CHEESE SAUCE is made from fresh vegetable and cashew.  Without the nuts, the sauce won''t be quite as creamy.  So, if you have cashew or nut allergy, you need to get something else. *** NOTE. All MAC items contain nuts, including some other dishes.  2) CAULIFLOWER SOUP (4.5/5)I like the soup while some of us thought it was a bit salty.  If you think it is too salty for you, you can dip it with your burger too.  It was another way to tone the saltiness down.  3) PORTOBELLO BURGER (4/5)4) POTATO BURGER (3/5) If I have to choose which burger is tastier, I will have the Portobello burger.  I love mushroom, and PARKA FOOD knows the right way to cook their mushroom.  A bunless option is also available as request.  They will serve your burger on a bed of ORGANIC ARUGULA instead of buns.  Very healthy, indeed!We tried three side dishes which were;5) ONION RINGS w/ Chipotle Aioli (3.5/5)6) CAULIFLOWER FRITTERS w/ Garlic Aioli (3/5) 7) FRIES (2.5/5)It seemed that everyone including the table next to us like the Cauliflower Fritters more than those two side dishes. They couldn''t stop eating it.   However, I prefer the Onion Rings than the Cauliflower Fritters.  I thought that the Cauliflower Fritters were a bit too salty for me.  I''m also a fan of onion rings lol.  The Fries were quite salty for us too or maybe we had too many fried stuff already lol.  However, Fries are never good without salt.  If you don''t like salty food, you might be able to ask them to do less salt on fries.  I''m sure they''re willing to do it for you. DRINKSGINGER SODA (4/5)STRAWBERRY SODA (3/5)GRAPEFRUIT SODA (3/5)They have Four types of soda drinks.  My favourite one is the GINGER SODA.   It was refreshing!  They have Coffee, Tea, Beer, and Cider as well.  You can have a small vegan party here, Cheers! AMBIANCE (4/5)  It is an opened-kitchen.  You can see food prep right there at the counters.  I like the clean and modern looks of the restaurant. SERVICE (5/5) OVERALL (3.7/5)The concept of commitment to sustainability is cool. The food is good.  The owner, Eric and his staff are nice and friendly.  Thank you for inviting me to the tasting event.  It was a nice experience.  I would recommend it to anyone, especially my vegan friends.   Also, I will come back to have my Truffle Mushroom again or try out other soup items.

Here''s what we tried: The Broccoli BurgerLightly battered broccoli florets, mac sauce, sauteed onions, roasted garlic, lettuce, dill pickles, parka aioli on a bun. The sandwich was a fair size, but surprisingly, was quite light. Battered broccoli is a very original idea for a burger but there are only so many pieces that can fit in between two bun halves! The flavours were on the mild side, letting the broccoli and the dill pickle (which added nice crunch and tang) do most of the talking. Parka provided a really good Siracha with a nice kick to it and that sauce really amped up the burger. The PoutineFresh cut potatoes, fried, herb seasoning, Mac sauce and organic mushroom gravy.

I have to say I''m not normally a coleslaw fan but this one is so refreshing light and not drowning in sauce! My partner really liked the tomato soup. Oh and we got the grapefruit soda and it was an actual soda water + grapefruit juice mix! Not just soda in a can. Really appreciate this spot and how environmentally friendly they try to be (Not a plastic cup or utensils in sight). Only thing is it''s a bit to the pricey end.

At the Yelp boat cruise, they were there to serve their wide variety of mac n cheese so it made the decision easier.The owner welcomed us at the cash and made some interesting suggestions. I was thirsty but didn''t want to start off with beer that they offer. He suggested the ginger soda that was very popular and created in-house. Next, I ordered the portobello burger as I am a big fan of mushrooms over potatoes. I added some fries to top off my meal.When I asked about the mac n cheese, he told us that there was no cheese as one of its ingredients. I was surprised since I had a taste on the boat cruise and didn''t notice. When I had a quick taste from my friend''s order of mac n cheese, I then realized that there was not a cheesy taste.I loved the portobello burger considering that I prefer a beef patty. It was a nice taste. The soda was amazing as I could see it cure my cold instantly. The fries were a bite salty but had a nice crisp.  I also tried the mushroom soup from another friend but found it a bit salty.Overall, I would return with my friends if they want to try out a vegan meal.

Great service, great food, lovely decor and a fair price.Amongst the myriade of greek restaurants along the Danforth''s "Greek-Town" is this small but yet mighty Greek Cypriot restaurant.

We all loved our food, but honestly, 4 starters amongst the 3 of us was overly decadent.

As I walked into the restaurant I see the sign that says: Rikkochez! Serendipity! I had not had homemade Shashuka in almost a decade. A man from Israel that I hosted via Couchsurfing had made me this delicious veggie stew with eggs on top and served with fresh bread. I didn''t even look at the menu. I told the man: you had me at Shashuka! This Cyprus version is a little different, it had little meatballs and the seasoning was different. It was absolutely delicious!

INSERT INTO review_info(Restaurant_Name,Review) VALUES ('Rikkochez','My girlfriend and I decided to try a Sunday brunch - something we try less  frequently since the arrival of our now one-year-old bundle of joy. We decided to hit a place on the Danforth we had tried and enjoyed once before, but despite arriving shortly after 10:00 am, the place was slammed, with many large groups with families (we reasoned they were fueling up for the Santa Claus Parade which was that day).Fortunately we remembered Rikkochez, where we had brunched once before and which was a short stroll west. After almost taking the safe option and popping in to the Detroit Eatery, we continued on to Rikkochez to discover all but one of the tables open.I forget what we ate on the previous visit, but it cannot have been what we ordered this time, as these were dishes we will not forget. I had the Turkish eggs, and my girlfriend the shakshuka. The Turkish eggs were to-die-for delicious, savoury chili oil, gooey egg yolks and just enough crunchy salt in every bite, drizzled at the table with generous dollops of their own house-made habanero hot sauce, all propped up on a fresh and delicious pita. The shakshuka was equally on point, fragrant with cumin and stewy tomatoes - less like spaghetti sauce than some places do. And complete with meatballs, another welcome addition I have not seen elsewhere. Even the coffee stood out as bold - I took the for me rare step of adding cream to smooth it out a bit and enjoyed every drop.The spicily-sauced dishes were a bit too piquant to share with our little Bubba, but he was well-served by samples of toast and some of the poached egg and meatballs cleansed of their sauce accompaniments.Finally, the staff were warm, friendly and attentive. And the hall, which had been near empty upon our arrival, was deservedly as full as our original destination had been by the time we packed the little monkey, and Sophie la giraffe, up to brave the short stroll back to the car. Five full stars. Look forward to exploring the supper menu. I regretted not taking a picture of the Turkish eggs before devouring them, as I could not find one on Yelp. I almost dared to ask a woman at an adjacent table if I could photograph hers which arrived shortly after I was finished, but reckoned it might be an intrusive request, so you will just have to go order them yourself.');

It was empty when we got there so for awhile it felt like our own little clubhouse. FYI this place is all vegetarian and vegan. This includes some meat substitutes like fake sausage and tofu scramble, but also they have real eggs too. There are two brunch options: one savoury, one sweet. My partner and I opted to get each and split them, which was a great choice since he had already eaten a snack about an hour prior so wasn''t famished. For the savoury side of things, we got scrambled eggs (FYI they only come scrambled, not fried or any other way), refried beans, a green salad, hash browns, and toast. Everything was really good - perfectly cooked eggs, tasty sides, and loved that it was served on a thali plate so everything had its own little compartment. For the sweet, it was a coconut yogurt parfait with granola, berries and pomegranate seeds. Loved the selection of toppings and it was nice accompaniment to the rest of the meal.

There''s a guy and a girl who work there regularly and he is always good at remembering to clarify that we want the vegan omelette since we''ve gotten into such a groove, we sometimes forget they can''t read our minds and that, heaven forbid, there could be any other version than my beloved tofomelette!Speaking of other versions, I would be ever so tickled if one day they offered vegan waffles. I so love waffles and their strawberry compote here is amazing in the summer. I bet if they did make vegan waffles, they would be awesome. Plllllease try!Some other wonderful things to note: Open for dinner and LICENSED. Yes, you can enjoy a glass of wine or a bottle of beer at a charming, little hippiester vegetarian cafe on a breezy summer evening. For some reason this is a real novelty in Toronto, vegetarian places that serve. The selection is short and sweet, just like the menu. The dinner items include gems like the burrito (vegan option with all the fixins, right down to sour cream), risotto, and pasta.More loveliness: the coffee, the tea, the sucanat, the charming decor, walking through the kitchen to use the loo, the book shelves, the vintage bar which is part of the new set up, the music, the pantry items they sell *including* vegan Worcestershire sauce, and watching the sunset on Dundas in the early winter after a late, late meal.Cash only.

Coffee was topped up often so I kept well caffeinated which is never a bad thing.The bathrooms downstairs were quite grody and there was a giant dandy long legs staring at me as I peed, but it added to the charm and character of this cafe.');

The bread is thick, crispy, and grilled to perfection. These two order is more than enough for a meal. The three sauces come as complimentary with the empanadas and the garlic one is my favorite.

This was really slowing up the process. I saw one person take forever trying to get different things into the bowl which then could not really close. Meanwhile the next dishes on the line were getting really backed up. I ordered a tofu bowl with succotash and chick peas. The bowl came with way too much rice (maybe more than 1/2 the bowl was rice, which became a problem for folks adding lots of toppings). The sauces were very strong. I would rather have the ingredients speak more for themselves but I saw a woman in front of me pester for extra sauce so to each their own. Because of the line I did not add any extra cold ingredients on top. The bowl itself though was very good. Just needs a lot less rice and more efficient ordering style (maybe limit the number of cold ingredients and/or take that info down earlier).Next time: hopefully the timing and ordering gets worked out.');

We were surprised by how meaty and juicy the wings were! They came with a handle which made dipping a breeze. On their own, the wings tasted mainly salty and grilled, not spicy as their name suggests. The garlic sauce provided the real flavour and it was a perfect creamy, garlicky blanket for those wings. I just wish the serving size had been larger. The hot sauce just added more salt, so I don''t recommend it. In the end, the wings were tasty but 6 wings cost us 16$+ tax and I think that''s way too steep for an appetizer-sized dish. And to top it off, Copper Branch charged me extra for a second, teeny dipping sauce! The carrot keftedes were baked balls of carrot, garlic, turmeric, fennel seeds, onion, fresh mint, organic chickpea flour, organic cornmeal, organic sunflower seeds, nutritional yeast, organic corn flour and spices. The balls sounded nice on the menu, but they were just not that interesting IRL. Mild in flavor and soft in texture, I won''t be ordering this dish again.

INSERT INTO review_info(Restaurant_Name,Review) VALUES ('Copper Branch','Vegan options in downtown Toronto, while definitely available, are not as enticing or plentiful as some of the legit neighborhoods. I was looking for a quick cheapish lunch before heading back to Pearson, so I wanted something relatively close to Union Station.Copper Branch had a decent looking menu (sandwiches, burgers, some salads, etc.) and price seemed reasonable enough. It was a bit challenging to find at first, but only because it didn''t occur to me it would be in the underground shopping area of the building (didn''t get much into that whole experience when I was in Toronto).So Copper Branch is part of a food court type area, but definitely not your normal food court fare (at least, not what you see in the States.) My partner and I decided on the TLT sandwich, some fries, and a small order of the wings. While none of the food really wowed me, it definitely served its purpose and was tasty nonetheless. The wings were made from the standard drumsticks you can find at many Asian grocery stores (or restaurants, for that matter). They were dressed up in buffalo sauce, but a pretty mild one (if you ask me). The aioli dressing they came with was good, but could have been better if it was more ranch-oriented.The TLT was a bit odd; more random veggies in it than I would expect. It wasn''t bad per se, but not what you''d expect for that description. Fries were straightforward, though I would say the portion was generous for the price.So while I wouldn''t go out of my way to eat here again, I''d definitely consider it an option if I needed something quick downtown.');

Aside from not looking as advertised I began to chow down. As you might relate to this - when you are starving anything you eat seems delicious; however it this case it was the opposite the burger missed the mark. My assumption was that there were pieces of fresh mushrooms, this tasted as soy mushroom processed pieces that I have tasted at Asian restaurants.

However, I find Copper Branch to be a bit overpriced when compared to other options in the area (the bowls here are ~$3 more than most alternatives and are also smaller). The burgers are also a bit overpriced, but do you really have another option when it comes to plant based food in the PATH? Otherwise, I think the food can hit you quite hard and you can feel a bit bloated and lethargic after eating here.I gave Copper Branch a try when I first started eating vegetables during the work week. My first order from Copper Branch was a portobello mushroom burger ($9.75); this turned me away from Copper Branch for quite a while. I took a bite into it and my tongue was burnt - it also was not that tasty.Two weeks later, I got tired of ordering the exact same thing from Kupfert & Kim every day. I gave Copper Branch another try - I got the shitake teriyaki burger ($9.75). Now, this is a fairly overpriced burger, just like the first - but this one actually tasted really good.From there on out, I actually frequented Copper Branch - I got either the general copper bowl ($14.25) or the shitake teriyaki burger ($9.75). Some times I order it with extra shitake, but I feel like it''s just a bit too much at times. I don''t know why, but after I eat at Copper Branch, I often feel a bit bloated and lethargic - the food is tasty though!');

After about the 5th attempt, and trying something different every time, I gave a breakfast item a go, the South West Wrap Scramble. It''s as if whoever made it threw everything on a crumpled wrap and used their fists to roll it up. The ends weren''t closed in the least, so the excessive liquid poured on the paper wrap, down my fingers and my arms, and food just kept falling out.

INSERT INTO review_info(Restaurant_Name,Review) VALUES ('Planta Queen','As a fan of the original Planta location in Yorkville, I decided to give Planta Queen a try when it opened a new location in downtown.**AMBIENCE**The ambience gets 5 stars. As soon as you walk in, you''ll notice how beautiful and elegant the interior decoration is - Asian-inspired patterns, arches, pink sakura trees, and dim lighting against a dark background. The music is hip, upbeat, and modern. Even the little details (such as how things are laid out on the table as soon as you arrive) are noteworthy.**FOOD**All the dishes are Asian-inspired vegan dishes that are good for sharing.Shanghai Slaw - The green papaya and coriander / cilantro make the salad taste very refreshing, and the shaved crispy onions added a nice crunch. If you like cilantro, this is the dish for you. It has a little ''kick'' to it though. Not bad overall.Udon - BEST DISH on the menu. This is a must-get if you come to Planta Queen. The miso coconut milk broth is rich and comforting. There are plenty of truffle-scented mushrooms in the dish, which have a ''roasted'' aroma and are very tender (there are at least 2 different types of mushrooms). The udon noodles are nice, thick, and chewy. There are also some greens in the mix. Tip: The shaved truffles are optional, but I suggest adding the shaved truffles - they add to the richness of the dish that already has a delicious and satisfying level of 10/10.Snow Pea Leaves and Yuba - Another favourite dish from the menu. Snow pea leaves and yuba just go great together. The texture and taste are slightly different than the typical snow pea leaves & beancurd sheets dish you get in regular Chinese restaurants. Here, they''re softer and less coarse. The sauce is good and not over-powering. This dish goes great with the udon.Sashimi Pizza - Half of the pizza is topped with dehydrated watermelon, and the other half is topped with mushrooms. The base is not really pizza dough... it''s very thin wafer-like phyllo dough that is somewhat crispy and easily crumbles. This is a plus because it makes the dish not too heavy, leaving room for other yummy dishes. I thought using "dehydrated watermelon" is an interesting take to try to mimic salami or salmon sashimi. However, the taste of the sashimi pizza is just off (in my opinion) - sweet and spicy, but with a strange taste and texture. This is my least favourite.Ssam Lettuce Cups - Fun dish to share, since you get to assemble your own wraps with Boston lettuce, filled with spicy BeyondMeat sausage, kamut (wheat grain), cucumber, pickled / gochujang cabbage, and rice crackers. Great crunch.Hawaiian Pineapple - Nice light dessert to end the meal. The pineapple pieces are refreshing. The dish is plated quite nicely with passion fruit gelato in the middle, surrounded by tapioca pearls and pineapple.**SERVICE**Service is pretty attentive and food comes out pretty fast. The server explains each dish that comes out. The restaurant tends to get very busy and packed, especially during weekend meal times, but there is a bar where you can wait if you decide to walk in without a reservation.');
INSERT INTO review_info(Restaurant_Name,Review) VALUES ('Planta Queen','Planta Queen is the newest star in the constellation of Chase Group''s upscale plant-based restaurants, in partnership with Chef David Lee. After the original location in Yorkville, followed by South Beach, the newest restaurant on Queen Street has a definite Asian flair.Coat check is available upon arrival. The bar sits at the front of the house, surrounded by tables, overlooking the streetcars gliding along Queen Street. A few steps up brings us to the main dining room, with softer lightning and plenty of seating. Japanese maples dominate the centre of the room, while bold wallpaper adorns the walls. At the back, the kitchen is visible through a large amber glass panel.The menu comprises of offerings ranging from nigiri, maki rolls and salads, through dumplings and small plates, all the way to larger wok, noodles & rice dishes.I was intrigued by the Japanese inspired offerings, and decided to start with  Mushroom and Unagi Eggplant nigiri, followed by Rainbow Roll. The Unagi Eggplant (lemon, pomegranate) was served in unagi sauce, and did a notable job mimicking the texture of real unagi (eel). The mushroom nigiri (truffled soya) texture was interesting and reminded me of abalone. The Rainbow Roll (ahi watermelon, avocado, crispy mushroom, gochujang) had nice flavor; the crispy mushroom strongly reminded me of deep fried fish texture.They were both nice light starters for a meal.Our first main course - General Lee''s Cauliflower (sesame, scallions) - was seared in a sweet sauce; the outer crust had a nice texture, slightly crunchy; the serving size was on the small size for a main. Our second main - Udon (truffle scented mushrooms, miso coconut milk, chives) - was absolutely our favorite dish of the evening; the coconut sauce was heavenly (not sure if there was green curry or something else in it, besides miso), and paired very well with the mushrooms and greens (I believe baby bok choi and watercress). I wish they had bread, so I could soak and have all the sauce at the bottom of the dish.On our server''s recommendation, for dessert we ordered Hawaiian Pineapple (bubble tea pearls, passion fruit gelato, lime leaf) and Halo Halo (matcha gelato, tropical fruits, purple potato, condenses coconut milk). Hawaiian Pineapple was our favorite; it was refreshing, not overly sweet, and the flavors were simple but memorable; honestly, I could not tell there was passion fruit in the gelato. Halo Halo was colorful and interesting with many different flavors, but seemed that something was missing to bring them all together.Service is professional and efficient. Parking is available in one of the numerous parking lots in downtown, such as city hall or on the corner of St. Patrick St. and Michael Sweet Ave. Easy TTC access by subway on University Ave. or streetcar on Queen St.');

Osgood station is conveniently located next to it. It''s huge, fancy and very modern. It definitely feels like the high end restaurant it is. Everything in this restaurant is sleek, simple and elegant. It was not busy at 5:30 on a weekday evening. The ceiling are very high and the décor is in tones of rose gold, black and more dark colours. Even the washrooms are fancy. Everything looks and feels very clean.There was music playing and generally a good vibe to this place. Planta on Queen has a very Asian inspired menu. Even the cutlery and table ware do not disappoint with its simplicity and elegance. The prices are very high commensurate to the small portions. This is a place to try many items on the menu with friends. The waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu. Everything is plant-based despite having a menu name like "tuna". We were a table of three with one drink menu and two dining menu. I was not impressed. We tried the potato truffle - cabbage, coconut milk lemongrass broth. Four pieces of truffle creamed in a sauce of lemongrass. It was very lemongrass and flavourful. I wanted to lick the cream but the plate was taken away too soon. Next came my favourite - the shitake mushroom pizza. It was eight slices of heaven. A very thing phylio pastry that was half shitake and half dehydrated watermelon. It was all topped with watercress. The shitake half was oyster mushrooms thinly sliced as toppings. The dehydrated watermelon was over red onions and a nice spread. The final plate was the rainbow roll maki - ahi watermelon, avocado, crispy mushroom, gochujang. Eight pieces of battered mushroom topped with avocados, dehydrated mushrooms and served with soy sauce on the side. The ginger was good. Overall, this is a must visit place to try items on the menu. The presentation of  food here was on point...very elegant and tasteful to the eyes. We ended up with a third plate of rainbow maki on the house. Thank you Planta!');

INSERT INTO review_info(Restaurant_Name,Review) VALUES ('Planta Queen','Hi, my girlfriend and I went to Planta Queen for a date night. We were particularly excited to try the newly opened vegan restaurant since standards preceded it. It''s well known that other Planta restaurants have done well to create delicious yet still reasonably priced vegan cuisine. How quickly we came to regret this decision.*1 Star for Ambience*2 Stars for Service *Sidenote: Service was great, with servers naming off ingredients to every dish they put down along with garnishes.  Very friendly, almost overly attentive.  If you don''t want to read a long review, this place asks you if you want Sparkling, Still or tap water, don''t just assume if you say still they''ll give you tap.  The server gave us bottles of Still water that were $8 a bottle without telling us, maybe she wanted to increase the bill, maybe not, but that''s ridiculous regardless.* At first glance, the restaurant is a sight for sore eyes, beautifully decorated, with an Asian-inspired ambience, dragon-koi-fish wallpaper, and even a tea colored semi-open kitchen that mimicked that of a traditional Chinese Dim Sum + Cuisine restaurant. We started off with cocktails for the full experience. My girlfriend ordered the "Blame It On The Aperol", while I ordered, to my disappointment, the "Sake Sangria". Now, a cocktail can be inexpensive, whilst at the same time being flavorsome and enjoyable.  During this experience, quite the inverse.  I will say that the Aperol was slightly like a spritzer, sweet with the fizzy-ness of a soda, the "Sake Sangria" was definitely not worth $15+tax. Are you kidding me? It didn''t taste of a $15 cocktail, maybe more like $5 special for what tasted like someone simply mixed watermelon juice and some sake. Onwards to the A La Carte, we ordered General Lee''s Cauliflower, Dan Dan noodles, Spinach & Shiitake Dumplings, Potato Truffle Dumplings, Spicy Tuna Roll, and Rainbow Roll. All of these dishes are organized below: 1) General Lee''s Cauliflower (3/5)While I understand this is a simple dish with fried cauliflower, "General Lee''s" dressing, sesame seeds, and scallions, it a reasonable dish. Although not too far from going to the food court and take sesame chicken sauce and essentially layering it over fried cauliflower.  2) Dan Dan Noodles (3/5)A somewhat modern take on what is considered a timeless Chinese Sichuan classic. Dan Dan noodles are originally very spicy, this dish was not spicy at all, quite the opposite.  It was played in a coconut sauce, which made it light and deviated away from Dan Dan noodles original mantra, catering almost too a child''s palate.  Kamut was an interesting addition to the dish as it added a certain level of "popcorn" like mouth feel? But still a miss.  The biggest problem with this was the portion size.  Once again for the price you pay ($15+), you can get a better dish almost anywhere with 2-3x the portion size. Humorously ridiculous. 3) Dumplings (1/5)Not much to say here, if you''re looking to eat good/great Asian dumplings, you won''t find them here.  Shiitake and Spinach or Potato Truffle, both skins were overcooked with no bite.  It''s as if I was biting into a baby''s snack. Personally, I believe that in order for a dumpling to even be considered good it must have an Al Dente skin for a satisfying chew.  In this case, I felt like I was biting through nothing to the steamed to mush ingredients within. Just because your ingredients are "premium" doesn''t mean that you can just throw them together and charge whatever you want for them. 4) Maki (2/5)Overall lack of vinegar, sugar and salt. We could taste that the rice had been exposed to air for too long . Honestly, the only reason this made it to a 2 is because the crispy mushrooms inside the Rainbow Roll actually tasted good, but once again, ($15+) for a tiny little 8 piece roll? Ahi Watermelon and Pickled Watermelon inside the Spicy Tuna Roll took away from the dish, the sourness of the roll doesn''t help establish "Tuna" in the name.  I don''t think I need to go on about how this place has failed to uphold the Planta name. I understand that all Vegan restaurants are always aiming to open up an avenue for Vegans to enjoy cuisine freely and without compromise for taste.  However, I sincerely believe that Planta Queen is simply taking advantage of unknowing vegans, and pocketing too much money for the sub-par food they serve.  YES, it''s premium, it''s a fancier establishment, but I could go to any vegan or otherwise fancy establishment in Toronto, and come out with a better experience, better food, for less money. We ended spending $140 total after tax and tips. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯');

Planta on Queen is the newest addition to the Planta restaurant group that makes Asian inspired refined vegetarian and vegan cuisine. The restaurant is super chic and boasts a list of interesting cocktails like sake sangria and kombucha mojitos. The restaurant does family-style dining so naturally we ordered several dishes for the table that were shared. We ordered the papaya slaw salad, wok fried eggplant, curried lentils with dosa and vegan nigiri. The papaya slaw was a combination of green papaya, cabbage dressed in a super flavourful dressing. The eggplant was a little greasy but the flavours were unreal and the generous helping of roasted peanuts added the perfect texture contrasted against the softer eggplant. The dosa is a gluten free rice flour wrap that is served with curried lentils and a homemade salsa. This dish was absolutely delicious and did not taste gluten free. The dosa was crispy on the outside with a softer interior. Finally the nigiri was the biggest surprise of the evening. Perfectly cooked sushi rice was adorned with vegetables that simulated fish. The preparation of the mushroom and eggplant had the same texture as raw fish. The taste had all of the goodness you get from the freshest fish with no seafood flavour undertones. If you like the texture of sushi but don''t enjoy the taste of fish, then this is the perfect dish for you. Planta on Queen does delicious vegetarian cuisine in a fancy atmosphere.
